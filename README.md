  Retrieval-Augmented Generation Q&A system for food safety compliance in UK commercial kitchens, with ingestion of official documents,          semantic retrieval using Qdrant, and answer generation via Hugging Face LLM (FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend).


- [**Sentiment Analysis with Federated Learning & Differential Privacy**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/ai-privacy)  

  Built an LSTM model to classify customer reviews while preserving privacy with TensorFlow Federated and Differential Privacy optimisers.


- [**ChefQuizAI**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/chef-quiz-ai)  

  AI-powered Symfony web app for food-safety training and assessment quizzes with trainer/chef roles, OpenAI integration, and MySQL backend


- [**Airline Ticketing Database (SQL Server Project)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/airline-ticketing-db)  

  Designed and implemented a full SQL Server database for an airline ticketing system. Includes schema in 3NF, constraints, stored procedures, triggers, views, functions, role-based security, and backup scripts.


- [**Clinical Trials Analysis with Spark SQL**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/clinical-trials-spark-sql)

  Exploratory analysis of U.S. clinical trials data using Spark SQL.  
  Identified frequent trial types and conditions, calculated average durations, and analysed diabetes-related trends with visualisation.  


- [**Steam Game Recommender with Spark MLlib (ALS)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/steam-recommender-als) 

  Built a collaborative filtering recommender system for Steam games using Spark MLlib.  
  Prepared implicit feedback data, trained and tuned an ALS model, and generated top-N user recommendations with evaluation metrics.

  
- [**Concrete Mix Compressive Strength (R Project)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/concrete-strength-r)  

  Statistical analysis of concrete compressive strength using R.  
  Includes EDA, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA, robust ANOVA) with a full report and reproducible R scripts.


- [**UK Marriages Forecasting (R Time Series Project)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/uk-marriages-forecasting)  

  Forecasting annual marriages in England & Wales and the UK using R.  
  Applied ETS and ARIMA models, performed diagnostics, and generated ten-year forecasts with comparative evaluation.


- [**Global Population & Urbanisation Dashboard (Power BI)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/global-urbanisation-dashboard-powerbi)  

  Interactive Power BI dashboard analysing global population trends (1960â€“2050).  
  Focuses on the **urbanisation process** (rural vs urban population), with breakdowns by region and income group, projections, and comparative insights.

  
- [**Adult Income Classification (Python)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/adult-income-classification).

  Supervised classification on the Adult Census Income dataset.  
  Includes EDA, preprocessing, and comparison of KNN vs Random Forest models, with evaluation metrics and   discussion of ethical/bias considerations.


- [**Wholesale Customers Clustering (Python)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/wholesale-customers-clustering)

  Applied clustering on the Wholesale Customers dataset (UCI ML Repository).  
  Includes EDA, preprocessing, and comparison of two clustering algorithms with business-oriented evaluation and actionable recommendations.  


- [**Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks (Python)**](https://github.com/JoseWongg/amazon-reviews-sentiment-analysis).
